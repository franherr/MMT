A modular multiplication table is a circular representation of modular multiplication by a positive integer 'a'.
To make a modular multiplication table, take a circle in a plane and place m equidistant points around its circumference and label them p = 0, 1,... m-1. 
Then chose a multiplier 'a' and connect each point 'p' to 'ap mod m' with a line segment. This creates a circle with line segements through the middle.
For more information on modular multiplication tables, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlHmuKqpJl0.

This project will allow the user to draw whichever modular multiplication table they wish to, with many style settings.
